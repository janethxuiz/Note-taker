# Note Taker Starter Code

The Note Taker app can be used to write and save notes.

# How to use

Click on the Start button to begin. When you get to the notes page you will see a + button on the top right side you want to click that and this will allow you to begin a new note. Once you add in your notes again on the top right side, a save icon will appear. This will allow you to save all notes you have written and save all data in a JSON file. On the left side of the app there is a box that will display all saved notes.
